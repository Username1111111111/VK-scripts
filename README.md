**Generaly you need to:**

2) Insert respective script inside browser console (i.e. click F12 in chrome and ctrl+c -> ctrl+v in console)
3) Wait untill all work done (it takes some time)
4) Enjoy the result 👍

**Individualy for every srcipt:**

1) Delete all photos.
Messages -> attachments -> (photos) -> Scroll till bottom of attachments -> launch script

2) Delete all videos.
Messages -> attachments -> (videos) -> click one time at any video to launch video player -> 
close video player -> Scroll till bottom of attachments -> launch script

3) Add all (subscribers, friends) to blacklist.
