You need to:
1) Navigate to specific section
2) Insert respective script inside browser console (e.g. click F12 in chrome and ctrl+c script -> ctrl+v in console)
3) Wait untill all work done (script work takes some time)

Scripts are not ideal but doing it's work (some videos or photos can be skipped).
If something was skipped - launch script again after reloadin whole page.
Also you can do some job manualy.
